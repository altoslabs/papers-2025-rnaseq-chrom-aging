(this “Agreement”). If you do not agree to these terms, you have no rights to the Software

following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
“Derivatives” means any modifications, enhancements, improvements, derivative
works, or technology based on or generated through the use of the Software, including,
without limitation, any software, data, models, inventions (whether or not patentable),
results, content, or other materials created by or on behalf of Licensee using the Software in

2. GRANT OF LICENSE
2.1 License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensor
grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license, under all
intellectual property rights (including without limitation copyright, patent, and trade secret
rights) owned or controlled by Licensor in the Software, to use, reproduce, modify, and
create Derivatives of the Software solely for non-commercial internal research and
educational purposes. This License does not grant any rights under third-party intellectual
property rights that may be necessary to use or practice the Software or any Derivatives
thereof.
2.2 Restrictions. Use of the Software is limited to internal and non-commercial research
and educational purposes, and Licensee may not use or allow others to use the Software for
any commercial purposes, including, without limitation: (a) any use by or on behalf of a
commercial entity, (b) for commercial research or development, (c) product development or
testing intended for commercialization, (d) consulting services, and (e) for the conduct of
clinical trials or regulatory approval processes leading to commercialized pharmaceutical,
biologics, or medical devices. If Licensee’s research leads or may lead to an invention or
technology or other Derivative with the potential for commercialization, and Licensee desires
to commercialize such invention, technology or Derivative, Licensee must negotiate a
separate commercial license with Licensor before using or otherwise exploiting the Software
or Derivative for any commercial purposes, and Licensee acknowledges and agrees that
Licensor may elect not to grant a commercial license in its sole discretion.
2.3 Distribution. Licensee may copy and redistribute the Software, including
Derivatives, provided that: (a) such redistribution is non-commercial in nature and for
internal research or educational purposes only; (b) a copy of this Agreement is included with
all copies or portions of the Software; and (c) any distributed version includes a clear and
conspicuous notice stating that the Software is licensed for non-commercial academic use
only and that commercial use is prohibited without a separate license from the Licensor.
Licensee may not relicense, sublicense, or distribute the Software or any Derivatives
incorporating any portion of the Software under any license other than this Academic
Research License (Non-Commercial Use Only). Any such distribution must retain this
Agreement in full, without modification, and clearly identify the Licensor as the sole licensor
of the original Software. Licensee may not impose any additional or different terms,
including without limitation open-source licenses, Creative Commons licenses, or
institutional licenses, on the Software or any Derivatives incorporating it.
2.4 Licensee Certification. Licensee certifies that (a) it is an individual who is a faculty
member, researcher, student, or staff member affiliated with an academic research institution
and (b) it is accessing and using the Software solely for non-commercial academic research
purposes on behalf of the academic research institute with which it is affiliated and not on
behalf of or for the benefit of any for-profit commercial entity.
3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LICENSE BACK.
3.1 Ownership of Software and Derivatives. Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest
in and to the original Software, including all intellectual property rights therein. Licensee
retains ownership of any Derivatives it creates, but any such Derivatives remain subject to
this Agreement. Nothing in this License shall be construed to grant Licensee any ownership
rights in the original Software.
3.2 Availability of Derivatives. Licensee shall make all Derivatives created under this
License publicly available in a publicly accessible repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and shall
notify Licensor in writing of the location of such repository. If requested by Licensor,
Licensee shall also provide a copy of such Derivatives for archival or integration into
Licensor’s Repository.
3.3 License Back to Licensor. As a condition of this License, Licensee hereby grants to
Licensor a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive
license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, under all of Licensee’s intellectual
property rights in and to any Derivatives, to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works
of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, license, and otherwise exploit such
Derivatives—whether in source or object code form—and any results or outputs derived
from the use thereof, for any purpose, including commercial purposes, without restriction.
3.4 Reservation of Rights. Licensee has no rights, licenses, or authorizations with respect
to the Repository, Software or Derivatives except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
3.5 Unauthorized Commercial Use. Any use of the Software or any Derivatives
incorporating the Software for commercial purposes without a separate commercial license
from Licensor constitutes a material breach of this Agreement. In the event of such
unauthorized commercial use:
(a) Licensee agrees that all rights, title, and interest in and to any Derivatives,
modifications, or enhancements created in connection with such use shall automatically and
irrevocably be assigned to Licensor without further action required by either party.
(b) Licensee shall pay Licensor liquidated damages in the amount of $50,000 USD or
five (5) times the fair market value of any product, service, or process developed using the
Software, whichever is greater. The parties agree that this amount is a reasonable estimate of
the harm caused by such breach and is not a penalty.
(c) Such unauthorized use shall result in immediate termination of this License and may
subject Licensee to injunctive relief and additional damages as permitted by law.
4. PUBLICATION AND ATTRIBUTION.
4.1 Publication. Licensee shall have the right to publish the findings, results, or academic
work arising from research conducted using the Software, provided that such use and
publication are consistent with the non-commercial, academic purposes permitted under this
Agreement.
4.2 Attribution. Any such publication must include appropriate attribution to the
Licensor and, where applicable, a reference to the Software as specified in the documentation
or requested by Licensor.

REPOSITORY AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES
OF ANY KIND. LICENSOR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM
COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
FOREGOING, LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE
SOFTWARE WILL MEET LICENSEE’S OR ANY OTHER PERSON’S
REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVE ANY
INTENDED RESULT, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY SOFTWARE,
SYSTEM, OR OTHER SERVICES, OR BE SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, FREE
OF HARMFUL CODE, OR ERROR FREE.

INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, DEVELOPMENT OR MAINTENANCE OF THE
REPOSITORY OF SOFTWARE SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS
INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SOFTWARE, OR OTHERWISE OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE
HEREUNDER EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO
LICENSEE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED $1,000.00.
6. TERM AND TERMINATION
6.1 Term. The term of this Agreement commences as of the date on which licensee first
downloads, accesses, or uses the Software and will continue in effect unless and until: (a)
licensee ceases to possess or use any copies of the Software or Derivatives or (b) this
Agreement otherwise terminates pursuant to Section 6.2 or 6.3.
6.2 Termination. This Agreement and all licenses granted to Licensee hereunder will
automatically and immediately terminate if Licensee breaches this Agreement or no longer
meets the certification criteria of Section 2.4.
6.3 Termination for Patent Action. If Licensee institutes or actively participates in a
patent infringement lawsuit (including a crossclaim or counterclaim) against Licensor or any
other recipient or licensee of the Software alleging that the Software or its use, reproduction,
or distribution infringes any patent owned or controlled by Licensee, then all rights granted
to Licensee under this License shall terminate immediately upon the filing of such lawsuit.
This termination shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies available to
Licensor.
6.4 Effect of Termination or Expiration. Upon the expiration or termination of this
Agreement, except as expressly provided otherwise herein: (i) all licenses granted to
Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate; (ii) Licensee shall immediately
cease all use of the Software; and (iii) Licensee shall, within ten (10) days, return,
permanently delete, or destroy all copies of the Software, including any related
documentation and materials, in its possession, custody, or control, and shall, upon request,
certify such deletion or destruction in writing.
6.5 Survival. The following sections, and any other provisions of this Agreement that
would customarily be deemed to survive, will survive the termination of this Agreement for
any reason: Sections 2.4, 3, 5, 6.5 and 7.
7. GENERAL PROVISIONS
7.1 Assignment. Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any right under this
Agreement. Licensor may assign this Agreement at any time with no notice to the Licensee.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties’ successors and
permitted assigns.
7.2 Waiver. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power, or remedy
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power, or remedy. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by
the waiving party to be effective. A waiver of any breach or default shall not constitute a
waiver of any subsequent breach or default, whether of a similar or different nature.
7.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties and
supersedes all previous oral and written communications by the parties, concerning the
subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may be amended solely in a writing
signed by both parties.
7.4 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is an agreement between the parties
and is for their sole benefit, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit, or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
7.5 Independent Contractors. The parties have the status of independent contractors, and
nothing in this Agreement nor the conduct of the parties will be deemed to place the parties
in any other relationship. Except as provided in this Agreement, neither party shall be
responsible for the acts or omissions of the other party or the other party’s personnel.
7.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed exclusively by, and construed
exclusively in accordance with, the laws of the United States and the State of California,
without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The federal courts of the United States in the
Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California shall have
exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.
Each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts and waives any right it may
otherwise have to challenge the appropriateness of such forums, whether based on the
doctrine of forum non conveniens or otherwise. The United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.
7.7 Attorneys’ Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking
damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in
connection with such action, including any appeal of such action.
7.8 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal,
or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, and the
remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties intend that any
such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, be reformed, modified, or limited by such court so as to be valid, legal, and enforceable
while preserving as closely as possible the original intent of the parties as expressed in this
Agreement. If such reformation is not possible, the provision shall be deemed severed from
this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall remain valid and enforceable. The
invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction
shall not affect its validity, legality, or enforceability in any other jurisdiction. The parties
further agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any such severed provision with a valid and
enforceable provision that reflects the original intent and economic effect of the severed
provision to the fullest extent possible.
